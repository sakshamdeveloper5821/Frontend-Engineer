# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## ADD TODO 
In addition to the ability to add and delete todos, the todo list also supports nested todos. This means that users can create hierarchical relationships between tasks by organizing them into parent-child structures. This allows for better organization and categorization of tasks, enabling users to break down complex projects into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. The nested todos feature provides a comprehensive and structured approach to task management, facilitating better planning and tracking of progress.on.

## LOGOUT
The application provides a convenient logout button located in the app bar, allowing users to easily log out from their account. By clicking on the logout button, users can initiate the logout process, enabling them to securely sign out from the application and end their current session.

## FORM VALIDATION
Form validation is seamlessly implemented in the application through the use of Formik. With Formik, the form inputs are validated based on the defined validation rules and constraints. When a user submits the form, Formik automatically validates the input values and displays appropriate error messages if any validation errors are detected. This ensures that the user inputs meet the specified requirements and helps maintain data integrity and accuracy within the application.




## USER DETAILS
All user details are readily available in the __mock__ folder in a file named userDetails.json. The user details are stored in JSON format, allowing easy access and retrieval of the required information. This mock data serves as a simulated representation of real user data and can be used for testing, development, or any other purposes that require a simulated user dataset.
